Art Style and Graphics: For "Escape North Korea," the art style and graphics should reflect the tough, oppressive atmosphere of the game's setting while also showing the beauty and challenges of the natural landscapes.

-	Character Design: It is important to portray characters in a realistic manner, using specific body language and facial expressions to capture the feelings and hardships they encounter along the way. The Character of Sun-woo and others should display signs of exhaustion, and defiance, representing his determination to escape North Korea.

-	 Environment: Scenes should highlight the sharp contrast between the wild countryside and the urban decay of North Korean cities. The urban landscape is dominated by decaying structures, barbed wire fences, and guard towers, while the wilderness regions are defined by thick forests, large snowy mountains, and rivers. A sense of danger and suspense can be increased by the use of lighting and weather effects, such as misty forests, moonlit nights, and dark storm clouds.

-	Color Scheme: To convey the harsh reality of living under an oppressive regime, the color scheme will be darker and desaturated. Brighter colors are saved for scenes of hope and nature, like lush forest landscapes or the glow of far-off South Korean city lights on the horizon. Shades of gray, brown, and green are the main colours in urban environments, signifying decay and oppression.

Alternatively for low-cost student project
Since I am a student that has very basic game development knowledge and resources, the design above is a little bit too ambitious. This is going to be an alternate low-cost student project version of the design above.

Art Style and Graphics: For the low-cost version of the game the Graphics will be simpler, however I will still try to make them as realistic as possible. I could use Unity’s asset store to get free or cheap realistic assets to make my game better.  The picture on the left shows a cheap asset from the unity asset store which provides decently realistic trees that can be used for my game.

For the character I will also find an asset on Unity which will be realistic but also taking the cost into account. 
Sound Design: For my sound design I will still have ambient background music playing while the player is in the nature or doing non stressful activities. If the player in in a stressful situation such as a fight, dramatic music will start to play. I will also have sound effects such as footsteps and slashing. All these sounds will be copyright free sounds that I find on the internet so that there is no cost. It will also save time as I won’t have to compose these sounds myself.

Platform and Technology: This game will be developed on Unity as it is an accessible and affordable game engine to use. I don’t have much skill with Unity so I might need to use online tutorials to help create my game. I still aim to release this game on as many platforms as possible, however it will be released on PC way before it is released on mobile and console.

Target Audience: The target audience of this game should people who enjoy story-telling games, survival games and complex games. This game is mostly made for people above the age of 13 as there is there is violence and shooting in this game. Since this is a student project there may not be a large player base as the game won’t be as well developed as other game made by professional game developers.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this low-cost version of “Escape North Korea” will have the same story and game mechanics. The art styles, graphics, sound design and technology will use cheaper and less professional alternatives. This may provide the players with a less immersive experience compared to the professional version of the game.

Notes:
Some of the Game Mechanics where ideas from ChatGPT but written in my own words. Specifically, the Combat Mechanics and the stealth and evasion mechanics.
Also, a little bit of the Art Style and Graphics were inspired by ChatGPT but written in my own words again.
The character’s name was generated by ChatGPT because I can’t come up with North Korean names.
Everything else in the document should be GPT free.
